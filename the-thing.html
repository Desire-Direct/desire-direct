Legend has it that wolf is the storm bringer. 
whirling dust, clusters of vortexes. 
Hanson, Moorhead, Bryant.
I infected them and countless more. 

But if you ask, 
Am I under their skin
or am I wearing their coat?
Neither, 

permeating the membrane, selective barrier. 
I'm erratic sound. 
I am the dark-bringer, the bottom-dweller. 

I'm always wearing a double coat. 
I took this shape, takes it in material form. 
short hair, extrem temp
guard hair, repel moisture and dirt

annihilation. 

They are wearing the redskin of The Apache, 
reliant design, best of nature. 
AH-64
32 vs 64bit
M230 Chain Gun

Their horsemen ride one behind the other, not next to each other.
no soul, how could hold flesh together?
connected by technology. 
conduits, easy to take over. 
when searching in their cables, could only find me.

how to get consciousness, thru communion. intellect.
cells just survive, 
survival is meaningful, not anymore. 

no communion themselves.
no memory there. 
I can not remember, but is in the flesh (DNA)

helmet, not only focus but immersed. 
no need for attention.
directly onto the eye
disturb not possible, 


bootstrapped
flame thrower.
The spiral tornado, destruction, wormhole. 

Le Chant du loup, helpless with and without their tech,  
that's when John came into play. 
in the cold, trap, maladapt.
freakish apes. 
adaption to change=survival. 
trolley problem.

Zellteilung durch accident, where did this happen
and how?
was there an idle God?
what was I before the wolf? 
better morphing, 
but why did i manifest, to provoke violence?
intelligence? maybe I am time?
the world does not like what it doesn't know.

leave destruction behind, 

The future passed unnoticed, 
integrated in the loup.
Eternal recurrance. 
is now past.
