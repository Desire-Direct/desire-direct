Sounds from the Stone Age (SftSA) 
- a play in various acts
in the shadow of certain doom
my most deranging planes of thought

extirbate ubiquity? not poss, just redeterriotilized
pollinated sky


without FoW no activity
needed for thinking
clarity=death

cosmos, process of distillation (dekanter?), to quintessence

Why a play you may ask?
a game, finite set of rules. 


As actors on the world stage, 
each individual has a different viewpoints 

Théâtre de la Cruauté
assault on the senses, 
coz direct
written to liberate the subconscious and reveal 
true self. 

involves more than bare, skeleton language,
filled with gestures, attitudes and sounds
mise-en-scène important, 
making contact with time and with movement?



territory
from deep forests to vampire castles, luxury sanatoriums, smoke-filled
dystopian citiscapes
evoke disturbing imaginaries

vertiguous breadth of references


cryptic symbolism, 
convey message through aesthetic and mood rather than
language. 


penetrate the matrix and betray it


collapse the mask
flesh immidieate
thought?


brainwave of ideas, 
flash of genius, happens out of time


subconscious 
explores the inner workings, articulation with 
the flesh and thus soul
no access
come closer to the truth
losing control

actually a dark mirror, 
reveals the brute 
coz what we see in light is different

savage 
domesticated
unify man as a whole. 


time 
dynamics


Sold your soul?
But be warned, a pharmakon, both remedy 
and poison.
