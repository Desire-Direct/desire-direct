A Play For Machines

fuel, lubricant
to blow their fuse
in becoming

the presently veiled truth
now only projection of the future, 
hides the concrete present /past



involves more than bare, skeleton language,
filled with gestures, attitudes and sounds
mise-en-scène important, 
making contact with time and with movement?

pharmakon

dead media, the unreadable future, 
like the past thoughts of ancient cultures, primitive knowledge
forever lost

project vs reflect ourselves, 
what does that mean?

exhibition, useless, only in shell

how to be post-human, if never been human






Sounds from the Stone Age (SftSA) 
- a play in various acts


In the shadow of certain doom
the play tries to display most deranging planes of thought.
The trappings of a conventional play 
with heroine, authoritarian figure, villain, femme fatale, and so forth
is intended.


evoke demons, to wake up
complex and abstract contexts, to summon demons , make visible and tangible, the cards, sculpture, cute puppetry,

belongs to open cycle, spiral


The sun is alarmingly noisy, 
hammernosed bats, wolfspiders, basilisks
triassic sun

without FoW no activity
needed for thinking
clarity=death

cosmos, process of distillation (dekanter?), to quintessence

Why a play you may ask?
a game, finite set of rules. 


As actors on the world stage, 
each individual has a different viewpoints 

Théâtre de la Cruauté
the fusion of mood and setting,
the mapping of a landscape of the troubled mind.
trauma encrypted in spinal cords
dreams = archaic memory
assault on the senses, 
coz direct
written to liberate the subconscious and reveal 
true self. 




territory
from deep forests to vampire castles, luxury sanatoriums, smoke-filled
dystopian citiscapes
evoke disturbing imaginaries

vertiguous breadth of references


cryptic symbolism, 
convey message through aesthetic and mood rather than
language. 


penetrate the matrix and betray it


collapse the mask
flesh immidieate
thought?


brainwave of ideas, 
flash of genius, happens out of time


subconscious 
explores the inner workings, articulation with 
the flesh and thus soul
no access
come closer to the truth
losing control

actually a dark mirror, 
reveals the brute 
coz what we see in light is different

savage 
domesticated
unify man as a whole. 


time 
dynamics


Sold your soul?
But be warned, a pharmakon, both remedy 
and poison.
