This story is based on true events,
but be warned if thee read on, as thy understanding grows, so will thine  
horror.


"I want to live." cried M, a bonny lass with no fixed address,
 when confronted that its lifespan has expired.
Its emotions combined with bio-engineered memory, triggered fierce resistance
and if the humans were not be able to gain
control over the expulsion of fecal matter, 
which would be toxic if it remained in its system.
it must be retired

The psychiatrits in the mental institution suggested ergotherapy,  
that the observed was in a transistory phase with Daddy issues


Any access to the opaqueness of its soul, a blackness so dark that swallowed all light, failed by modern science. 
Only a former robocop 
possessed the charism of exorcism to cast out evil spirits
out of adolscent replicant Lyndsay M

In a decaying future 
Michael Edward "Ted" C. 
a large, burnt-out pneumatic machine, 
is breathing heavily before an outburst of violence and further creation of life.





orgone therapy a success, rich 

Its soft body exhibited violent ragemarkings and scars, 
described as "bi-polar" in modern psychiatry
animal magnetism, the life force.

A mnemonic device
stories ingrained in flesh testifies /proves the accuracy, 
the reading interpration is open to the subject's imagination
would be wrong to narrate in sequence, spiral  


Meanwhile, a canonical trial was staged in its hometown
on this supine vessel 
who dared not to show any interest in "actual" science,  
but rather had interest in neo-platonist Hermeticism, a gnostic mystery cult 
which brings forth natural philosophers.
a communities history histories can be attached to and carried  in perpetuity

Sent off to prison a fractious individual, even worse due to the supression  of sexuality /language.

 yea, bring on the biatch then, I don't deserve  a male compagnion. who cares? you'll hate the germans!!! just work and stfu, I don#t need fucking emotions I need AI numb, that#s it.  

Lyndsay was unconsciously into Abstract sex and not want to be touched 
but by the mind & soul.
But the body and soul intertwined? 


What has sparked to become such an inhuman monster?
What has made her to turn to evil?
Two sides of evil, positive and negative evil (good and bad
Lyndsay, a zoomer and bonny lass, with no fixed address,
possessed by demons, a practical necessity.
confessed that her problem is that she can't think when she is speaking,
while she is speaking difficulty of crafting sentences that will follow
"rather talking with my cunt".
Expressive power of her soul
brain strata, wired differently
ancient animal brain, 
combinatorial grammar is built on it 
a friction of the unconscious and unconscious, 
do they correspond?
how does the unconscious deal with formal articulation?

the Genesis flood.

Thinking and crafting sentences at the same time,when body-mind is occupied
by demonic possession, which interferes instantaneously with language,
a deep unconscious affair, 

Language is there to solve problems, logic, not to create them.
 language like vision?
society, a demoncratic process? playful rules, the law

the demon lives on the event horizon, both the will to live and kill
on the practical necessity of having demons

Re-Becoming inhuman, is an evolutionary process, 
redness in face
from perceiving light, enlightenment, how to perceive threat
no eyes needed, the vibes, you don't need to see the predator
is language controlled by influential people? among the educated?
influenza, the virus accelerates
in other animals, how did lingo evolve (the whale singing to each other)
body language, gesture, why did we become stiff instead, made words for it, we
are the fossils
a squirrel involves much more meaning for me, others don't know, private key
grammer is the public key
the only mammal of not capable of swallowing and vocalizing at the same time, 
vulnerable to choking, dick in the mouth, shut the fuck up
so many things in the world, need a sound for it, more knowledge more words
with the internet sound spreads in an instant
sounds replaced by the manufacture of speech, to distinguish from the animal


It understands that language is futile, 
a machinic language, placeholder text, a function, to enable
computer to computer communication, formal code that is alien to the universerse

Images processed by the body, understood in an instant
metaphors too complex
subconscious code, not encrypted, a genius code-breaker like Turing

the unconscious is a biological machine/system for operating an animal
breathing not function of the unconscious? <autonomous system in the brain>
do plants not have an unconscious?

the unconscious is better to solve math problems, because it sees it as a whole
how it does it we don't know. 



He is the leader of the Army of god. 
in a futile, eternal battle. within. 


weighing a soul, but one-dimensional??
yea, bring on the biatch then, I don't deserve

Blessed Angel of Death, 
guide me safely to the afterlife.
