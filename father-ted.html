Michael Edward "Ted" Prejit, a large man,
breathing heavily
was called to exorcize the demons out of 
12 year old Lyndsay M., 
the Genesis flood.
Any access to the opaqueness of her soul, a blackness so dark that swallowed all light, failed by modern science. 

The psychiatrits 
Art therapy, 
the demon 
that it was transistory phase. 
Daddy

Lyndsay, a bonny lass, with no fixed address,
confessed that her problem is that she can't think when she is speaking,
while she is speaking difficulty of crafting sentences that will follow
"rather talking with my cunt".
Expressive power of her soul
brain strata, wired differently
ancient animal brain, 
combinatorial grammar is built on it 
a friction of the unconscious and unconscious, 
do they correspond?
how does the unconscious deal with formal articulation?


Thinking and crafting sentences at the same time,when body-mind is occupied
by demonic possession, which interferes instantaneously with language,
a deep unconscious affair, 

Language is there to solve problems, logic, not to create them.
 language like vision?
society, a demoncratic process? playful rules, the law

the demon lives on the event horizon, both the will to live and kill
on the practical necessity of having demons

Re-Becoming inhuman, is an evolutionary process, 
redness in face
from perceiving light, enlightenment, how to perceive threat
no eyes needed, the vibes, you don't need to see the predator
is language controlled by influential people? among the educated?
influenza, the virus accelerates
in other animals, how did lingo evolve (the whale singing to each other)
body language, gesture, why did we become stiff instead, made words for it, we
are the fossils
a squirrel involves much more meaning for me, others don't know, private key
grammer is the public key
the only mammal of not capable of swallowing and vocalizing at the same time, 
vulnerable to choking, dick in the mouth, shut the fuck up
so many things in the world, need a sound for it, more knowledge more words
with the internet sound spreads in an instant
sounds replaced by the manufacture of speech, to distinguish from the animal


It understands that language is futile, 
a machinic language, placeholder text, a function, to enable
computer to computer communication, formal code that is alien to the universerse

Images processed by the body, understood in an instant
metaphors too complex
subconscious code, not encrypted, a genius code-breaker like Turing

the unconscious is a biological machine/system for operating an animal
breathing not function of the unconscious? <autonomous system in the brain>
do plants not have an unconscious?

the unconscious is better to solve math problems, because it sees it as a whole
how it does it we don't know. 



He is the leader of the Army of god. 
in a futile, eternal battle. within. 


weighing a soul, but one-dimensional??
yea, bring on the biatch then, I don't deserve 
a male compagnion. who cares? you'll hate the germans!!!
just work and stfu, I don#t need fucking emotions I need AI
numb, that#s it. 


Blessed Angel of Death, 
guide me safely to the afterlife.


the shadow of the whip
mysticism comples relationship to formal law

I've humoured her
peevishly
cried
eschew
