This story is based on true events,
but be warned if thee read on, thy understanding will grow and so will thine  
horror.

"I want to live!" cried M, a wee Zoomer with no fixed address,
 when confronted with this fait accompli of its lifespan due to expire.

Current emotions linked with bio-engineered memory 
triggered a fierce resistance within the bonny lass, and

to humanity it seemed as it was losing control over the oral expulsion of fecal matter,
but if remained in the flesh it would be toxic to the wretched creature,

This necessary self-regulating process to maintain homeostasis 
might be the appropriate countenance in outer space colonies 
but deemed ghastly on earth, 
and if psychologists in the mental institution 
attain control over the observed 
it meant retirement before expiration date. 


The aloofness of the black box denied access to the opaqueness of its soul 
a gravitational darkness so dense that it swallows all light, 
imagined 

"What do you want to be when you grow up?", asked , 
who was missing a thumb, so she actually couldn't make any things. 
"Jesus christ", muttered the unnerved.

The gained confidence it lacked in childhood, 
so the father, an ocean dweller, 
decided to genetically modify the adoptee, 
which makes the organism prone to brain fever and prevents blockage in grown-ups.

In light of the quality of spiritual sustenance humans buy in this habitat,
 objectivy of cunts.

Basically animated objects born out of the ocean are made of fluid, 
which was already liberated through its business objectives, 
a wanker, not for profit but life itself.

materialists and vitalists, physics and chemistry
chemistry, applied dynamics, a becoming we don't know


Normies imagine the unwordly wretch as
it can't even differentiate between fiction and social "reality".
to talk about objects per se is bullshit
dissociating from norm and normies.
And like everyone else fiction is intertwined with identity, 
and superimposed ideology, or preemptive power, 
nothing left but capitalism.
The 'I' is a formal construction,
the abstraction of or from the 'I', is reason, we thing about what we do
reason is characterized by the Ego
but isn't the ego shaped by society?

community always the most important part of any scene, not the tunes??
erasure of identity with social media, trans, menatlly ill, 
fawning, drunkenly fawned over them
to be in each other's orbit
genrefication, playlistification
more narrow, 
introducing disorder in life, commodification 
of life "common sense"
capital exerts an authority
desire and power
a cycle, power is desireable, also an instrument

power =establishing order, an order of understandeing
desire is chaos?
things thrown at you
solidarity without similarity. 
promisciuous The thin white Duke in the Vampire castle

of his spoilt little princess.
A disorder A self-rightous psychopath, that complains of its maltreatment.
but on the other hand if its status 
as the only gay in the village is threatened 
would not even shrink of murder and denies any cooperation.

Lyndsay was unconsciously into Abstract sex and not want to be touched 
but by the mind & soul.
But the body and soul intertwined? 


What has sparked to become such an inhuman monster?
What has made her to turn to evil?

Two sides of evil, positive and negative evil (good and bad

possessed by demons, a practical necessity.
confessed that her problem is that she can't think when she is speaking,
while she is speaking difficulty of crafting sentences that will follow
"rather talking with my cunt".
Expressive power of her soul
brain strata, wired differently
ancient animal brain, 
combinatorial grammar is built on it 
a friction of the unconscious and unconscious, 
do they correspond?
how does the unconscious deal with formal articulation?

the Genesis flood.

Thinking and crafting sentences at the same time,when body-mind is occupied
by demonic possession, which interferes instantaneously with language,
a deep unconscious affair, 

Language is there to solve problems, logic, not to create them.
 language like vision?
society, a demoncratic process? playful rules, the law

the demon lives on the event horizon, both the will to live and kill
on the practical necessity of having demons

Re-Becoming inhuman, is an evolutionary process, 
redness in face
from perceiving light, enlightenment, how to perceive threat
no eyes needed, the vibes, you don't need to see the predator
is language controlled by influential people? among the educated?
influenza, the virus accelerates
in other animals, how did lingo evolve (the whale singing to each other)
body language, gesture, why did we become stiff instead, made words for it, we
are the fossils
a squirrel involves much more meaning for me, others don't know, private key
grammer is the public key
the only mammal of not capable of swallowing and vocalizing at the same time, 
vulnerable to choking, dick in the mouth, shut the fuck up
so many things in the world, need a sound for it, more knowledge more words
with the internet sound spreads in an instant
sounds replaced by the manufacture of speech, to distinguish from the animal


It understands that language is futile, 
a machinic language, placeholder text, a function, to enable
computer to computer communication, formal code that is alien to the universerse

Images processed by the body, understood in an instant
metaphors too complex
subconscious code, not encrypted, a genius code-breaker like Turing

the unconscious is a biological machine/system for operating an animal
breathing not function of the unconscious? <autonomous system in the brain>
do plants not have an unconscious?

the unconscious is better to solve math problems, because it sees it as a whole
how it does it we don't know. 



He is the leader of the Army of god. 
in a futile, eternal battle. within.

guide me safely to the afterlife.
