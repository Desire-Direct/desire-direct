The true expedition began to form in the Borderlands of Bohemia
on a sunny, hot and dry day,
which we observed a rather grim territory, 
which just reflected the binary logic of the multiplicity.

We were eager to leave, 
the too cold and flat continental surfaces
surface good and bad, the colours will devour skin and flesh
but which an outlook 
and embark upon a journey on a Ceske Drahy, with its
tracks of tight curves and steep inclines.


The gridlocked situation 
on empirical values 
to experiment with current French philosophy.


Confused I was wandering the deserted station, 
a junction   
when an elderly man man approached me, "May I be of assistance?", he was asking in broken German,
I was relucant at first as he looked like one of those collectors of curiousities wating in his little shop of horrors to palm a cursed thing off on some naivete.
I went asking for the train to Klatovy, He pointed on the train on the rear track 4, which should have been departed a long time ago. 

The conductor, a young and very tall, lean lad, which catched my attention as he was one of those seldom hybrids of the old and the new, a fit athlete of body and mind. Characteristics needed, whistle strong
to signal departure of the train at each stop.
A spiritual wayfarer, 

His repeatedly hyperbolical pronounciation of my destination Lipno nad Vlatinou,Lipno nad Vlatinou,  
left room for much speculation.

</p>

This palimpsest is an attempt to describe 
the events that occured in the fall of 2022.

I am trying to imprint meaning on this hideously ugly inked coating,
veiling a supposedly innocuous device, 
which is an intermediate thing between a tool and a machine.

A system with deficiencies
but the analogous application permits

a  emergence of logic, 
which is dependent on the syntax of my native language. 


As a woke renaissance man, I am also  
inverting the gender of writing. 
She blares, I type. 
Typing is writing. 


I would not call it a compromise, but rather a diktat
of immediate command and control. 


The monopoly of script in serial data processing is female. 
I've surrendered the 
responsibilty the task of operation
and subsequently the negative feedback given. 

a circuit not a cycle. 

I am banging so hard, a recording of streaming to become immortal

The gapping wound widens, stretched wide open by her own hands, 


So how does it function?
vibrating diaphragm sets in motion the pen 
which in turn writes on the moving lubricant
strip 
what is the infrastructure, pipeline
a turing complete. 



Typing blind, can't see what I write, on this ancient machine
rwx ?? who reads, write, executes, allowed rule?
previously a men's world, now scapegoat for mistakes. 
world, ball.  

can't simulate the real, coz it's real, immidiate command and control
communication, urbanized warfare. 

the whirling membrane like a dervish
in a pulsating, pounding beat, that is connecting me with the beyond.  

Sama-zan in this ceremony, 
a rave of self-destruction
as its repetitive rythm 

in a frequency spectrum 

will awake the Krakonoš.

spread the word
need to bring into existance

reward later, punish 


I'm not able to sweat, so I 
pant through nose and mouth. 


The fear of death makes us butchers for own survival.

<p>
It is here my intention to point at the known unknowns, 
on direction of endless expansion,
but I will do this in the language and custom of the Great Old Ones.
Inhumans, including myself, got too curious, and dared to study cursed books,


fanged noumena 
that will possess the noumena with its sharp teeth. 
noumena (plural of knowledge), is an object (thing observed) independent of human sense
knowledge is the spirit, it is the unknown
in contrast /relation to phenomenon (object of the senses, but isn't that subjective???)


atavism=reappearance of genetic old features, Moorhead is the werewolf-rat, Erin is her past
animality is the undercurrent of modernity and reality

The antonym of matter is the unknown. 
this is a transaction, a super-heated lubricant of global becoming
spirit is ridiculous

Nonhumans on the other hand 
can't accept that the unknown 
is in a steady imbalance that cannot even be imagined.
and crushed the unknown with layers of bureaucrazy. 
A monstrosity, which nonhumans call the "normal",
and in which forms of rampant intelligence are blighted. 
paralyzed

A werewolf-rat, I got infested by the unknown, and 
transgressed with my flesh. 
Yes, I am filthy, I am covered in ticks and fleas,
my coats are sticky, my skin is encrusted with scabies, 
greenish boars get to vomit, when they see me. 




the more we manipulate the more information we gain
poking the open wound with a stick 

They haven't been on that fatal  cool trip Erin went,
from a global vs cosmic perspective, that can't be judged 
not good nor bad.



Too many correlations lead to utter madness, 
but the boundary of flesh and soul
is the only correlation that matters, 
to which only access to the correlation, 
pneuma that only art and poetry understands. 


Life has been torn into atoms and pieced together molecules,  
solution. 
The tyranny of the matrix, a medium for time
Newtonian physics and Descartian metaphysics
soluble
contains no facts, 
firstly because naturally unrelated,
and bears no ground at all. the ground is my habitat.  

the greatness of god, not killed, waited to be awaken. 
killing god in exchange for a more bearable life
and a limited consciousness.
Fearful they withdrew from nature/god, 
alienation on their own planet.  

So 'the paper' is more a a detailed account of collective memory. 
It has to be a resounding of carbon on membrane due to a
malfunction of our devices and the
abundance of plumbago and lack of paper.
The four horseman of the apocalypse. 
My fancy for 
Immutable, smart contracts, transactions, words
his dark voice 
What followed was a phase of senseless python, for weeks
I can't tell actually, as I've totally lost the feeling for time.
I've developed a wicked insomnia, which I've tried to compensate with a couple of hourse of rest before the clock strikes noon. 
u/acc, #rhett, #cave
To read the cursed book, some men will literally instead of going to therapy.

London sent me on this research residency to investigate paranormal incidents, 
which had to do with the inexplicable missing of astronauts.
Here I should perform under the motto of the secret intelligence service  
Semper Occultus. 

But what I found there in the sand, a former forrest, 
destroyed by acid rain, was beyond any comprehension.
Despite halt of economic growth, 
I found a shining example of hyperaccelerationism
Everything was about control, the residents, including the newly arrived immigrants,who were lured into it, truly believed in it, how out of control it really was. 


atavism=reappearance of genetic old features, Moorhead is the werewolf-rat, Erin is her past

unavoidable experiments, went into combat
"thought-experiments" not from armchair but the battlefield

An unpleasant MI5SON, easy for bellends 
bureau from the security service, who are into domestic counter-intelligence. 
Like Matthew Fox, known as K, co-founder and my best fiend
in this intelligence machinery. 


As a veteran analyst and natural philosopher, 
I was never able to translate my copious inventions into long-term
financial success. 
to mar
In truth they wanted to get rid of me, deemed uncomfortable
placed on the retired list as "unfit for service"
due to spacesickness. 
The ocean, I mingled with the RAF. 
And this is not due to the spinning of the earthcore
but with abstract chemosensitivity, yes, I am allergic to all plastic and the organised surface of reality, excavated and dried out in the sun subculture.
The matrix, weaved together by a grande narrative, based on dualism of black and white, the sky is gray. 

This military strategy forced my retreat into the Outside, 
'I' was born out of crisis, an Otaku, but the irony is, 
whilst I was sent to prison with others and you know who you are, 
and which so well benefited us, what is left of modern 'society' live in cells now,
in isolation, social outcasts, Alle gegen Alle, 
losing connection to home, as there is no one in the control center. 

 
but now they send me off, 
because of my stream of blood.
Partly, I share it with my indiginous ancestors, who lived on this land 
for many generations. witch mother, a stamp of strangeness
émigré community.
Race, gender, sexuality, don't matter anymore, it's class. 


I am classified as genetic trash even though I posess natural
machine vision on my left eye, on this geometric field of the chess game
random rectangles in different sizes with colors from the RGB spectrum
my hearing performance is extraordinary
interpretation sounds ghosts.
The frames switch on and off
simultanously
as my mental functions, such as perception, memory and attention
vision, movement, sensation, coordination
did not match the requirements of the MI5.
even though I'm much more qualified than those hoes.

I've lost an eye, stabbed it
with fountain pen. 
Also I adopted the motto "Every man his own stylo", 
I sent K a letter invisible ink.

On orders from above, 
moving through the most impassable jungle area,
I was greeted by many surprises, some shockingly awful, some delightful.
the former must be destroyed. 
So I came across this poor monkey covered in dust, 
as soon we made contact with his big brown eyes, his shy little smile at the realisation that he is alive 
that would melt the stoniest of hearts and minds!
On thorough washing, which I thought it truly necessary, I accidently broke his hand, which he needed for writing. He already lost one foot due to Plantar Faciities,
a remnant from the past

,
I felt so bad for the poor thing, I've started to nurture for him and let him rest on my wide chest. On that evening I've noticed a strange weather phenomenon, the sky turned orange, knowing he sent me an immesurable amount dust particles. 




The General in China whispered on the wireless
that the ape is an Arian Nazi and must be decapitated.
And why shouldn't I have been fooled by his appearance?
Fleet Street tabloids picture him as a inane, clumsy Gorilla
blanking out the danger that comes with the true nature of that brute inhumane beasts,
On afterthought, what would have been the consequences, to attack him. 
A trap that was set up by the jealous General, 
who knows my sweet-tempered nature too well, instead of killing I've locked him in the basement for a couple of days. 
Until the phase of hysteria was over, and came to my senses.
We became loyal companions since ever, clothing him bespoke London couture, 
wandering through the forest, sleeping beside me and sentinelling my camp, when I go on short excursions.
Love, that made me to build solid Wolfsgrub, instead of dwelling in that transitory French military tent.
In that platonic cave, drunk with love, 
my feelings toward, the most beautiful and pure creature.
Clothing protection from having sex. 
 

Their horsemen ride one behind the other, not next to each other.
no soul, how could hold flesh together?
connected by technology. 
conduits, easy to take over. 
when searching in their cables, could only find me.
Le Chant du loup, helpless with and without their tech,  
that's when John came into play.

Pneuma is not accessible to humans and has been made into a quasi-substance (solid), a representative, 
that is attached to regions of existance, like the jet of a black hole. 

The expedition together with Erin Bryant, a pundit,
because of her extensive academic background, or maybe because she just fucked around. 
Hapless visitors as we were, 


We had only nonlethal weapons with us,
for example a acoustic hailing and disruption (AHAD) device,
delayed auditory feedback (DAF),
to shut her up.

Neuralgia, depression, nervous breakdown, the symptoms that Eros, the life force, 
animal magnetism, has been buried with language, interweaved with the flesh.
The soul is the hole, the body the solid. 
Modernity made spirit the primary instrument, which is needed to pneuma and body are blind to each other, a relation to introduce them politely to each other, but has been the prime divider, and trying to keep them apart. 
Not able to put into words, so I've took action.

From afar I see a green mountain.
Away from the main path, a small footpath into the  virgin forest. 
On our way I notice a goshawk, motionless in the sky, until it fell from the sky, 
to devour its cute prey. 
I wait for some action, but it kept disappearing.

Autonomous engineered matter, intelligent materials

living material
I suffer from distorted reality perception, completely neurotic. 


On entering nothing specific attracted our attention 
consumated by this complex whole.
The deep we've stepped into, we only noticed the enormous silence, 
as if all life was eradicated but ours. 
Like being drowned in deep outer space, in a vacuum which is filled
with alien noise, of matter, which we, nor our scientific devices  could perceive.
Are we part of this alien environment?
Against my upbringing, and conduct as a scientist, 
I was just in desperation to hear something, which made me to kick a piece of wood
which I assumed to be dead.
The potent response was a gruesome finding. 
A teeming mass of now open cells in 
a structure of magnificent civil engineering  countless
wander past antigen-presenting cells 
each? many of them carrying eggs?, always on the lookout
for the right binding parnter for their antigen receptor.  

I walk past the mighty pillars, symbols what do they signify, human made
4 - the orange graphity tells, and I feel strangely alarmed by that number. 

I'm occupied with investigating another assumingly familiar structure,
a cabin filled with boxes. 


what is behind creation: randomness or design 
the wasp don't know, who is pulling the strings.
but part of environment, no one is pulling strings.
happy that someone else is pulling strings, but alone.
what does the spider make of the web?

can it see the beauty?
The interrogation felt a bit of safety,
when a massive flying swarm of drones comes from behid
Still shocked, I decide  to re-enter the main path
just a few steps on, I discover the potential nutrition source of the workers,
a small field of hideously  ugly plants, flowering in pink.
I can't tell what repels me, they don't belong in there?
their uncontrolled growth ? or, better put, if I look closer. 
what gross things I could find there? 
I walk deeper in the forest, always further drawn into it
with the faith in me
there must be some point of reference.

The three body problem 
nuclear family. 


I see a couple heading towards me, 
the man walks in front, the woman behind.
We greet each other politely,
oddly strange in this hostile solitude.
The first impulse of asking them about 
location determination,
that there must be an exit close.
The opportunity wanes, nobody wants to give itself the nakedness to break off
and thus we courageously fight in this 
infinite war alone.

Strangely, as this happened shortly after and can not be coincidence,
another scare event

I see a house, a manor house, beyond the trees.
On first thought, wealthy people must live there in this grande mansion
but here in the middle of nowhere?
Suddenly it was gone, and I see only,
time is creeping on from behind.

There is a high peak of this mountain ridge
where the warm sun reaching our skin, but cooling down in the shadows of deep forest.

Over time it dawned on me that the bizarre stories of my grandfather, 
were actually nonsense and a large share of the Great Wisdom.
The puzzling fragments were actually hints to further hollows
in the cryptic thicket of the Bohemian Forest.
Then I had to fill them with speculations, which in turn 
had to be assembled with existing structure. 
Spreading revelations in a magnificent horrific whole, I was bound to.

There were two young in the litter of the wolf,

as they were slowly roaming the land, 
on only their rear paws, unable to walk,
