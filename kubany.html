This palimpsest is an attempt to describe 
the events that happened in the fall of 2022.
I had to recall with carbon graphite due 
malfunction

Washington sent me on a research trip to investigate recent paranormal incidents, 
which had to do with the inexplicable missing of astronauts. 
But what I found there in the sand of the burning heat desert, 
was beyond any comprehension.
I have to add that I was sent to this unpleasant mission 
because of my blood.
that I share with my indiginous ancestors, who lived on this land 
for many generations.
I became ingrained, whether I like it or not, 
but in truth they wanted to get rid of me, 
as I'm apparently not fit for working in the office, 
as my mental functions, such as perception, memory and attention
vision, movement, sensation, coordination
did not match the requirements of the Pentagon.
even though I'm much more qualified than those hoes.
I am classified as genetic trash even though

My machine vision on my left eye, on this geometric field of the chess game
random rectangles in different sizes with colors from the RGB spectrum
my hearing performance is extraordinary
interpretation sounds ghosts.

The frames
cataclysmic

The expedition together with Erin Bryant, a scientist,
because of her extensive academic background.
I'm trying to retell the strange events here, but the real horrors I've experienced, 
not able to put into words. 
We became pawns in a much larger conflict and came to trust only our instincts.

We had only nonlethal weapons with us,
for example a acoustic hailing and disruption (AHAD) device,

call de loupe
From afar we see this gigantic green mountain
and a footpath drawn into a virgin forest. 
On our way I notice a goshawk, 
motionless in the sky, fell from the sky, never to be seen 
I wait, kept disappearing.
The silence in there, as without life
An inaudible enormous noise drove us mad, 
in deep outer space, a vacuum which was actually full
with stuff we couldn't perceive. 

not go completely crazy, not part of the environment
I kicked a piece of wood, which I assumed to be dead, to make a 
gruesome finding. 
A teeming mass of now open cells in 
a structure of magnificent civil engineering  countless
wander past antigen-presenting cells 
each? many of them carrying eggs?, always on the lookout
for the right binding parnter for their antigen receptor.  

I walk past Symbols on the mighty trees., what do they signify
4 - the orange graphity tells, and I feel strangely alarmed

So I'm occupied with investigatin another strange structure
a massive flying swarm comes from behind
Still shocked, I decide  to re-enter the main path
just a few steps on, I discover their potential nutrition source
a small field of ugly plants, flowering magenta.
I can't tell what repels me, they don't belong in there?
their uncontrolled growth ? or, better put, if I look closer. 
what gross things I could find there? 
I walk deeper in the forest, always further drawn into it
with the faith in me
there must be some point of reference.

A couple, not asking them
a futurist biker
I see a house, a manor house, beyond the trees
hallucination.

Over time it dawned on me, that some of the absurd puns
of my granfather, belonged to a far much greater story.

Puzzle fragments that now revealed horrific whole. 
However, there are some loopholes, I can only speculate about,
and mythical stories. 
born at the deep forest at the foot
of the majestic Kubany in the region of Sumava, he still knew about the 
rites of the Old Ones. 
My grandpa knew that when there will 
be no distinction between man and woman, 
this will be the end of days of the world.
Culture is dead, graphity, on the ramshackle mansion, nearby the 
warm moldau,

There were only two young in the first litter
of the wolf (she/her), who was the leader of the  pack. 
One can say this were the ancestors 
of the we'rewolf pack.
However, this was  a sign under the the two massive twin peaks
belonging to stomping ground.
Provoked it siemandl

Bryant also just can speculate, 
fissions by accident, without reason,
but when did this happen?
Was there an idle God?

better morphing, 
but why did i manifest, to provoke violence?
intelligence? maybe I am time?
the world does not like what it doesn't know.


There is a high peak of this mountain ridge
where the warm sun reaching our skin, but cooling down in the shadows of deep forest.
Cave entrance
We found the remains of 
The virgin forest was a singularity of geometrical perfection
a world, unbenownst to posthuman man
where everything connected together. 
no distinction between fauna and flora.

Asymetrical and symetrical shapes
formed perfect 

inumerable tall structures with of ineffable 
with a perimeter of 20 feet
fallen giants, horizontally or 
better in angles, 
a mathematic unknown to civilisation.
seen as 'dead', actually full of life,
hotbed, tangled  

rivers with distinct features
fossils

This forest seemed to be untouched for 300million years.
unbelievable any advanced civilisation, lived there, 
beyond any scientific evidence. 

The smell of green slime, no sound, just simulating energy.

The freakish alien apes
had a variety of extremities, like tentacles they were
growing out of their meaty bodies. 
4 of them equipped with further 5 smaller tentacles,
and one of them a thicker one, which was distinctively sticking out
on one side of their body
for grasping objects. What was the objective of doing so?
as they were slowly roaming the land, 
on only their rear paws, unable to walk,
which granted them  majestic buttocks,
a padding.
They enhanced their bodies with technology, 
the decadent generations mostly for ornamental purpose.

Must been to do with their Degenerated teeth, 
hard material, like stone, later then metal, which made believe to be 
immortal and incorruptible.

Anna Tant, whiteling

I've witnessed how a weakly looking man, who went by the name John, 
and who murdered my brother. 
He strived the woods most lone not with his kin,
and not killing with his fangs but with some artificial thunderbolt
that was followed by a sound of horror. 
echo that burnt deeply in the soul of the forest, 
The abhorrent smell of this creatures, 
triggered the reflex of flight in us,
seeking escape for those able to.
possess supernatural powers 
I previously said murdered, because his motifs
must be that of a maniac.
The true horror was not eating the flesh, drinking the blood but
sometimes habbit of skinning as a trophy
leaving the body to scavengers.
The scalp was in his possession, to touch it or to handle it 
only the exact way he wants it.

They spoke a strange language, their leader 'Black Mountain'
shared a huge affinity to the occupying forces and wanted to create
a prosperous disneyland.
