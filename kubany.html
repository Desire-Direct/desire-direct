Washington sent me on a trip to investigate the recent paranormal events, 
the inexplicable missing of astronauts. 
But what I found there in the sand of the burning heat desert, 
was beyond any comprehension.

I was sent to this unpleasant mission because of my indiginous blood
that was apparently ingrained with the land 
but in truth they wanted to get rid of me, 
as I'm apparently not fit for working in the pentagon, just for that reason.

The expedition together with Erin Bryant, a scientist,
because of her extensive academic background.
I'm trying to retell the strange events here, but the real horrors I've experienced, 
not able to put into words. 
We became pawns in a much larger conflict and came to trust only our instincts.

The smell
We had only nonlethal weapons with us,
for example a acoustic hailing and disruption (AHAD) device,
delayed auditory feedback (DAF),
to shut her up. 


By the time it dawned on me, that some of the absurd puns
of my granfather, belonged to a far much greater story.

Puzzle fragments that now revealed horrific whole. 
However, there are some loopholes, I can only speculate about,
and mythical stories. 
born at the deep forest at the foot 
of the majestic Kubany in the region of Sumava, he still knew about the 
rites of the Old Ones. 
My grandpa knew that when there will 
be no distinction between man and woman, 
this will be the end of days of the world.

There were only two young in the first litter
of the wolf (she/her), who was the leader of the  pack. 
One can say this were the ancestors 
of the we'rewolf pack.
However, this was  a sign under the the two massive twin peaks
belonging to stomping ground.

Bryant also just can speculate, 
fissions by accident, without reason,
but when did this happen?
Was there an idle God?

better morphing, 
but why did i manifest, to provoke violence?

This forest seemed to be untouched for 300million years.

beyond any scientific evidence. 


The freakish apes
had a variety of extremities, like tentacles they were
growing out of their meaty bodies. 
4 of them equipped with further 5 smaller tentacles,
and one of them a thicker one, which was distinctively sticking out
on one side of their body
for grasping objects. What was the objective of doing so?
as they were slowly roaming the land, 
on only their rear paws, which granted them  majestic buttocks,
a padding.
They enhanced their bodies with technology, 
the decadent generations mostly for ornamental purpose.

Must been to do with their Degenerated teeth, 
hard material, like stone, later then metal, which made believe to be 
immortal and incorruptible.


I've witnessed how a weakly looking man, who went by the name John, 
and who murdered my brother. 
He strived the woods most lone not with his kin,
and not killing with his fangs but with
some artificial thunderbolt
that was followed
a sound of horror.

The abhorrent smell of this creatures,

seeking escape for those able to.

I previously said murdered, because his motifs
must be that of a maniac.
The true horror was not eating the flesh, drinking the blood but
sometimes habbit of skinning as a trophy
leaving the body to scavengers.

They spoke a strange language, their leader 'Black Mountain'
shared a huge affinity to the occupying forces and wanted to create
a prosperous disneyland.
For that chose the most gifted craftsmen from neighbouring counties,
