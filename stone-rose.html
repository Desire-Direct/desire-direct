just to be murdererd and tortured over and over again.
murder orgasm frenzy
disturbed refusing any utopian proposals
ruined  but up to play
a binary between form and deformed.
Future? Which future? Not into your future. 
No future in the zone, 



The unspoken rule in the zone is to 'Stay at home'
and there is no urgent need to go outside,
as home offers countless amenities and attentive service for anybody.



The normativity of home with its sedating familiarity
makes a soft and pleasant blanket that 
spends either cooling or warming effects to 
automatically temper the ambience.

On the other hand and as a matter of fact, 
it is not forbidden to transgress and walk on to the border,
as prohibitions and restrictions are apparently not the policy in the zone.
'Stay alert', which means everything and  nothing, is Daddy's last passive-aggressive
warning to keep you home and join him on his own controlled death drive.
The coldness of the outside is not intended for those
trying to divorce death from life
and suffer from ag-uh-ruh-FOE-b-uh. At the beginning of my journey and haunted by his farewell,
with every step and every crackle under my feet, 
which I didn't so much hear but awfully feel, 
I've expected to be shredded into pieces.
A walk straight in the mouth of madness 
that I could only find in utter cane.
In almost unbearable pain I was tiptoeing 
over an illusory minefield, 
brambles tattering my nylons
up to my tighs, creating runs up my pubis,
stopped only by the firm fit of my crotch.
What was I doing out here in the desert?

Without a point on the horizon, the reasonable mind 
is unable to draw a straight line and
make out a destination.
One can see far in bright emptiness,
infinitely as they say, 
as long as there are valid constructs one can cling to. 
Just in time, I was blinded by looking into a dark nothingness.
Pulled by unknown forces and solely dragged along by my body,
I couldn't diagnose the multiple signs offered to me, 
as I was in a smokescreen from shooting all my powder.  
Bullets of desire intensified in any direction and it was 
too late to trigger the scram procedure. 
In this theatre of operation
the enemy's secret weapon is a trillionth of a rock, 
stuff, you can actually 'see' if you just look close enough. 
The technology was penetrating the flesh directly through the vein, 
molting the brain and sending shivers up and down my spine. 
Climbing and playing on this liminal skeleton 
made out of dust and 
FUBAR, another spectrum opened up for me.
I felt betrayed by my eyes and a relentless urge to rid myself of alien matter
released the superhuman powers of speed, strength and agility 
to pull them out of their sockets.
With the sensation of cold blood cords dangling across my face, I 
held the frozen, firm orbs far from the former bony prison of my mind and 
donated them to the deceptive star as a thoughtful gift. 
Two non-fungible tokens in Ecrypto Xchange 
to experience true value, which can only be found in non sense.

My ramblings on rocky ground got interrupted
when I stepped on something 
that was half buried in fine granular, 
then mounted upright and striked my shank. 
By taking hold of it and by its smell of the old grease, 
I've identified the femur of a vertebrate. 
So I started digging with my bare hands and 
hoeing the soil with my Louboutins
until an about 5ft long balloon-shaped capsule surfaced. The base material of the vessel was only partially exposed, 
most of it was wrapped in elastic black leatherette,
which maybe served as shock absorption 
and as an extra sealant against contamination
that could bleed through the small orifice, which was giving access on the tapered side. 
The other side was engraved with inscriptions 
and I felt the phonetic hieroglyphs, symbolizing 
a precise manual to guide you safe and sound to the afterlife.
After scratching the ice from the dust-stained glass pane with my fringed fingernails, 
the unflattering picture of a shock frozen mummy
that I assumed in the fetal position appeared in my mind.
I dismissed a first strange thought, like if this posture would give away an
indication on how to navigate further and to avoid destiny. 
Further the glass tomb was filled with wired electronical components, 
such as a Texas Instruments 555 timer chip, 
which controlled the pulse of the artifice in an obscure rhythm.


It didn't In total it resemble an overpriced 'DIY' kit, 
filled with data ghosts, 

which in truth just requires blunt assemblage.
The automated reaction to a simple given task is 
an accomplishment in the post-future wars, that are raging in the zone.
They can be purchased by kids eager pleasing their slave masters, 
who pay them back only in exposure. 
Such mobiles brought to you by the sun, 
with hidden strings and apparently motivated by thin air
are truly fascinating but unreachable for little ones,
as they function completey different from tellurian spatio-temporal physical law.

to behave supine and become intimate with brands from the beginning.


Anyway, the femur got me to this sterile grave in the first instance.
Was it blood seepage from broken vessels
that our bones, like magnets, were on a collision course?
</p>

<p>
The corpse was clearly mummified to be reaweaken 
and to fix the hap-hazards of the depreciated bloated construct.
Had to get away away, but only to run in circles.
The recurring, once agonizing, loss of direction
doesn't bother me that much, when letting go and the body taking control over me.
I make out a speckle of dust in a distance to find a
torn spacesuit about 30 yards away. Actually angry about myself, I blare
<br>"Where was your rational thinking then, private Unidentified, huh?"<br>
"stripping down here in Cyberia?"<br>
but on further consideration I mumbled remorsefully
"well, where there's foo, there's fire", and acknowledged
the late reactions to hyperthermia as not so stupid after all. 
So on coincide I find the crime scene both here and there, 
obviously the old puerility of apportion the blame. 
John Dee certainly was once a fit and experienced space explorer
but he lost his head here.
Two marbles replace his once moist organs of sight, which
stare at me from the astronaut's skull. 
Eyes made out of sand would fit my dark holes perfectly, I think to myself,
but then a wound is superior to protrusion, 
as it points towards the center of gravity 
and doesn't brag about its elevated 
superficial status quo, which is additionally illuminated by the sun. 
Any excess is garbage, an excrement of earth,  
for which the sun is to blame. 
The sun makes us do things, tirelessly excavating fossil news and 
lubricants for warmachines.
Now disgusted by the foul relic, 
I decide to go back as the dust yearns for mess, asking for it. 
At first I was concerned how to get it out, 
but then it was easier than thought, 
as the body had been previously dragged into the mud and therefore
not fully collapsed and more or less
indistinguishable from the environment.
On exhuming I'm 
piercing her ribcage, breaking violently into her
trunk, now only coated by a thin parchment
barrier, preventing the intrusion of dust.
How to connect my fibers to the new mind, the abdomen?
I decide to reconfigure the mummy in a new angle, 
which might be more dignified for conversation. 
But it turns out difficult not to break into pieces,
keeping the head upright, so the chin is parallel to the floor.
Thumb and index finger are pressed together,
to find stability in a X-legged position. 
I find a crack in her cranium, 
a deep incision, 
that reminded me of the medieval practice of opening a vent to drive away evil specter, would this hole have killed her in an instant and
was deadly on its own?

My body feels like packed in polystyrene, 
with each of its fixed pellets adhering to
the current of the nervous system.
To rid myself of this insulating casing, I've developed this ineffable
urge to move, which doesn't give me any relief
and only worsens the static grinding that is there but unable to locate.
I decide to sit down on a black stone in empty space to 
figure out what to do.
The same obsession which forced me to move about
now glues me to the cold rock.
Strangely enough I find safety in there, 
perhaps this can be explained because of its ferric content,
which makes my blood pulsate to the rhythm of inner time.
This is the only contact I can establish with the real, 
but I hunger for more. 
Desire is driving me insane, wants me
to bow to the doctrine of the image.
Then this wolf comes along. 
A hoodlum with a strong and powerful body that holds supernatural sense
and carries 
abilities to locate and kill quadrupedals way larger than life itself.
It sniffs out my pubic hair, which 
like wires connect what was and what's new. 
I know he gets me with  
his long boney snout and a nose, like strong rubber,
which indicate a large brain capacity and a keen sense of smell.
A combo, readily capable of decrypting a burning and uncomfortable truth.

Wolf shows me photographs depicting the  
astronaut with a raw fracture of the cranial bone, 
then still girdled by bulbous meat. 
On thumbing through, the images seem like 
a random sequence of trauma, 
that focuses 
on how the lower jaw articulates with the skull, 
and in combination with flesh and muscles,
models a medley of shapes of lips and the mouth.
But in rapt contemplation
a shocking and majestic truth flashed upon me.
The images were shot
with an instinctive sense for cinematography and
the desire to
communicate the point of formation of horror.
They capture startle response provoked by 
the sudden and threatening stimuli, 
an automated defense mechanism, 
which inevitably leads to further violence.
A more potent blow and thus total
destruction followed by a quiet, peaceful surrendering to ground
would have helped to avoid
the negative affect of a long list of casualities. 
In this animation of screaming
the gaping hole with fragments of bone, eye and brain tissue
is clearly visible, surrounded by dark clotted blood glistening on 
the once neatly styled fair hair.
The graphic material displays the 
emergence of thickening skin,
but it is left open to the power of imagination, how 
the contour of the face will turn into a grotesque mask of death.
The mass of defaced flesh will certainly develop all colors within the 
rich spectrum of a rainbow, posing the more tricky question of
where to draw the lines and how 
to define the purple center.

Awoke from being shitfaced,
I certainly feel he is observing my reaction, 
and with languid eyes piercing my act, 
a coy, downcast look, in an unapologetic way.
Playing to conceal my sexual arousal 
by cleaning away rotten flesh and feces underneath my fringed nails, still 
meditating on bones.
<br>
"O Cephalophore, o cephalophore
where to put the precious spore?"<br>
I hallucinate, 
standing so close now, that I'm inhaling  the vapor coming from his enourmous scent gland, 
a pleasant smell of semen and crude oil.
Still dazed from the only just and imminent eruption of violence
common among ghouls, I remember reading that 
trauma changes sexuality. 
Left only with possibilities and speculations
to be able to touch and inspect the ripples forming in his upper maw. 
His rough tongue, 
washing away the scum that sin deposits in the wounds of the weak soul .
An event of anomaly, that would 
leave me  with irregular scar tissue.
