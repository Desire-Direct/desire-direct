"I want to live!" cried PJ, a wee Zoomer with no fixed address and Daddy issues,
 when confronted with this fait accompli of its lifespan due to expire.

Current emotions linked with bio-engineered memory 
triggered a fierce resistance within the bonny lass,
perceptible in the outright oral expulsion of fecal matter.
If remained in the flesh it would be toxic to the wretched creature,
This necessary self-regulating process to maintain homeostasis 
might be the appropriate countenance in outer space colonies

loss of control over the observed.

It is a practical necessity on having demons, 
who populate the event horizon, and both enable
the will to live or kill the process.

A salient point, , most astonishing, 
considerable gap from humanity automaton,
of thinking and crafting sentences at the same time,
when body-mind is occupied by demonic possession, which interferes instantaneously with language,
a deep unconscious affair, 

The meat puppet was designed, 
that its thoughts became a vent for sex, 
otherwise programmed to do it all the time,
topped by an abstract technological layer, language.


"Are you single?", it was asked in the repair unit. 
"Yea, asshole."
PJ deeply despises the commodification of desire, crowned by the idea of marriage and ownership,
eradicating the element of weird that is key to romance, but understands the primitive function of love.
A right-wing advocate for the accelrated privatization of desire, not state.


All she asks is not how but what is Eros, 
stripped bare to its essence.
which is murder, gone on a killing spree to extirpate humanity, 
inflating bodies, a billowing mass of skin tissue and pulp, forcing time and matter on the inside, 
chemistry brimmed over. 
Fruit flies, leeches and maggots feast on its fertile vulva, hogtied, presenting its sanguine darkness.
Nothing and everything happening at once. 
A snuff ceremony to waken the dead cells, 
the bing bang imagined  just a stone throw away, but trillions of years away felt.

a machinic language, placeholder text, a function, to enable

The primal Internet, Eros, sometimes referred to as a "network of networks",

"What do you want to be when you grow up?", asked another member of staff,
who was missing a thumb, so she actually couldn't make any things. 
"Jesus christ", muttered the unnerved, "but you made me blow my game, asshole",
and lit up another cigarette, and inhaled the

Normies imagine the unwordly wretch as
